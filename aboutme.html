    Immersing myself into the rich spectrum of theatre, film and photography over the past few years, I have learnt to compare and contrast these mediums but also to merge their cinematic and performative languages through theory and practice. 

    After getting a BA(Hons) in Theatre and Film at Sir John Cass School of Art, Architecture and Design in London, my work usually includes live installations that combine and intertwine elements of pre-recorded media and live performance.

        I have worked in many different areas on a variety of projects and I am always looking for exciting opportunities that force me to think outside the box. I love making use of my creativity and I am constantly looking for new sources of inspiration. If you would like to learn more about my work, interests, or past projects feel free to have a look in my gallery. Should you have any questions, then please do not hesitate to get in touch with me!
